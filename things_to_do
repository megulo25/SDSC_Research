Next steps:

- Try out Auto-Keras, a keras implementation of Google's AutoML for creating
a neural network architecture.
    * Set it up for 555 class first (this requires training from folder)

- Take a look at Random Forest for feature importance on images.
    * https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree-multioutput
    * fit before changing n_outputs_ to 2.

- Implement Ensemble to improve model. 

- Use GANs to improve model. (Semi-semisupervised Learning)
    * Let the model be the discriminator and as the training progresses its gradients should improve.

- Figure out how to abstract the heatmap for each level of the hierachy.
