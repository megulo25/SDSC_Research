Next steps:
    - Continue working on MTL_vgg code for training.
    - Develop a train/dev/test set. (70/15/15)
        * The dev and test sets should be from the same distribution.
        * The dev set is used to tune the hyperparameters.
        * The test set should not be used to tune the hyperparameters.
        * This needs to be developed carefully, then we can iterate through models.
    
    - May want to look into Precision, Recall, and F1 score.
    
    - 5 fold cross validation

    - Implement the bounding boxes during the training. 
    - Create a classifier for identifying the birds.
    - Then use the classifier to implement YOLO to identify where the bird is. 
    - Then use heatmap to analyze the decision making process. 
    - We can include a combination of predefined hierachy and data in the database to reveal information about that bird. 
    - Then it can all go on the website.


- Heatmap of the image. Highlight important pixels in image.
