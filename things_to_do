- Make a nicer confusion matrix:
    *  https://plot.ly/~hema.vakade/162/confusion-matrix/#code

Each of the child class has multiple levels of parent classes that always has birds at the top.
For instance, 
    295 -> 179 -> 1 -> 0
    505 -> 35 -> 11 -> 0

Each folder's name is the child class. The bottom of the chain.
We need to create an output vector that will have all the classes.
Each vector will be 1010 elements long with multiple 1s inserted into each one.
Ex:
    class: 295 -> 179 -> 1 -> 0
    vector: [1 1 0 0 ... 0 0 1  0... 0 1 0 ... 0 0] where the 1s are located at (0, 1, 179, 295)

This is called multi task learning (multi headed monster).

Things to do:
- Set up training script for multi task learning. The loss function is covered. We just need to create a vector for each image.
- Finish code that will generate heatmap.

- Heatmap of the image. Highlight important pixels in image.
