Next steps:
    
    - Implement the bounding boxes during the training. 
    - Create a classifier for identifying the birds.
    - Then use the classifier to implement YOLO to identify where the bird is. 
    - Then use heatmap to analyze the decision making process. 
    - We can include a combination of predefined hierachy and data in the database to reveal information about that bird. 
    - Then it can all go on the website.


- Heatmap of the image. Highlight important pixels in image.
